Tutorials for expression parsing libraries


This project exists with the intention that contributors will make a list below of various expression parsing
libraries.

Then there will be one directory per library.   In each of those directories, there will be demo code
and a brief tutorial about how to incorporate that library into a CS56 project.

# List of candidate libraries
